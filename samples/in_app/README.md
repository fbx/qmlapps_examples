# In-app Purchase
Tiny example using in-app purchase API.

In this example, not being published in the FreeStore, buyable items are
fake items generated by the Shell.

During the porcess of development of an application with in-app purchase,
it is possible to test real purchase by setting the app in Beta mode in the
FreeFactory console, and creating items to buy. When the app is in Beta mode,
purchases won't cost money. To fully enable purchases, your app must not be in Beta.
