# In-app Purchase
Tiny example using in-app purchase API.

In this example, when the app is tested locally (not being published on the
FreeStore), buyable items are fake items generated by the Shell.

During the process of development of an application with in-app purchase,
it is possible to test real purchases by setting some users as beta-testers on
the FreeFactory console, and creating items to buy. The users listed as
beta-testers will be able to launch the app in beta (as well as the one in
prod if any), and their purchases won't cost them money.
